# Style usage

To use these styles you can do so by writing yaml at the top of each slide in
wrapped between three dashes `---`

```yaml
transition: swipeLeft
style:
  border: rounded
  border_color: "#FF0000"
  layout: center
  theme: dracula
```

title: Config
preset: dark

# Configuration

A configuration file is created by default in `~/.config/kyma.yaml` but you
can use another config file using the `-c` flag or by having a `kyma.yaml`
file present in the directory you are executing the command from.

A `kyma.yaml` file looks like this:

```yaml
global:
  style:
    border: rounded
    border_color: "#9999CC"
    layout: center
    theme: dracula

presets:
  minimal:
    style:
      border: hidden
      theme: notty
  dark:
    style:
      border: rounded
      theme: dracula
```

----

title: Global styles
---

# Global styles

You can define a global style config that all slides use if no configuration is
provided.

If we take a look at our `kyma.yaml` from before you can see the global
configuration in lines 1-6

```yaml{1-6} --numbered
global:
  style:
    border: rounded
    border_color: "#9999CC"
    layout: center
    theme: dracula

presets:
  minimal:
    style:
      border: hidden
      theme: notty
  dark:
    style:
      border: rounded
      theme: dracula
```

----
---
title: Presets
---

# Presets

Presets are a way to define reusable style configurations to apply to individual
slides withou having to copy pase each time

If we take a look again at our `kyma.yaml` from before you can see the presets
in lines 8-16

```yaml{8-16} --numbered
global:
  style:
    border: rounded
    border_color: "#9999CC"
    layout: center
    theme: dracula

presets:
  minimal:
    style:
      border: hidden
      theme: notty
  dark:
    style:
      border: rounded
      theme: dracula
```
